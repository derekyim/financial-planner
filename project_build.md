# Proposal
Here is what I propose to build

check out backend/final_assignment.md for details of the implementation

## UI
There is a react application already, I want to add a left hand navigation to completely cover all 7 tasks in the above Notion document

Agent - default location when you load the app.  should render a page to show the agent (this is currently the main ui page under /ui). this should be the default landing page
Idea - containing the project idea from the final_assignment.mf
Challenge - contains information to satisfy Task 1 from the Notion Document
Solution - 1 -2 paragraphs on the solution as described in final_assignment.md
Architecture - Architecture diagrams per Task 2 of the notion document
Documentation - Should have subsections for
- RAG Application - Detail approach for Task 3 from Notion document
- Evals - docs on evals approach
- Next Steps - Indicate the next steps, how this application will change for final "Demo Day" implementation.
Evals - should have subsections for
- Dashboard -  here we need to import code fom ../AIE9/10_Evaluating_RAG_With_Ragas/ and make an /evals/ subdirectory under backend and build out an Evals suite.. for this UI element we are going to provide links to Langgraph showing results..  satisfy task 5 by adding an Evals system
- Improvements- Satisfy task 6 by adding space for listin evaluation based improvements
