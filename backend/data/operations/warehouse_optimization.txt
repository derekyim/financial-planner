## Reducing Warehouse Costs

### Inventory Management

**Demand Forecasting**:
- Analyze historical sales data
- Account for seasonality
- Factor in marketing calendar
- Use 80/20 rule: focus on top SKUs

**Safety Stock Formula**:
Safety Stock = (Max Daily Sales × Max Lead Time) - (Avg Daily Sales × Avg Lead Time)

**Inventory Turnover**:
- Target 4-6x per year for most products
- Slow movers (<2x): liquidate or reduce orders
- Fast movers (>8x): may need more safety stock

### Warehouse Layout

**ABC Analysis**:
- A items (top 20% by volume): prime picking locations
- B items (next 30%): secondary locations
- C items (bottom 50%): back of warehouse

**Pick Path Optimization**:
- Zone picking for large warehouses
- Batch picking for similar orders
- Wave picking during peak times

### Labor Efficiency

- Cross-train staff for flexibility
- Use pick-to-light or voice picking
- Implement quality checkpoints
- Track picks per hour metrics

## Reducing Shipping Costs

### Carrier Negotiation
- Get quotes from multiple carriers
- Negotiate based on volume commitments
- Consider regional carriers for specific zones

### Packaging Optimization
- Right-size boxes to reduce DIM weight
- Use poly mailers when possible
- Negotiate custom box sizes with suppliers

### Zone Optimization
- Distribute inventory to multiple locations
- Use zone-skipping for high-volume zones
- Consider 3PL partners in key regions
